# DataAnalyst nanodegree - Data Visualization Project

## 1- Context
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, Python visualization libraries are used to systematically explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple variables. In the second part, a short presentation illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships discovered in the selected dataset. The primary method of conveying findings will be through transforming your exploratory visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.
Find the code walkthrough [here](https://jocelyngiquel.github.io/udacity-data-visualization/data_viz_divvy.html) and the visualizations slideshow [here](https://jocelyngiquel.github.io/udacity-data-visualization/data_viz_divvy_slideshow.html).

## 2- Data set used
2017 individual bike trips information from the city of Chicago, available through [Divvy system data website ](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data) either downloaded from the website or collected programmatically from the available web JSON feed.
